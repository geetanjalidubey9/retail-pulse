# Step 1: Use the official Go image as the base image
FROM golang:1.23.3 AS builder

# Step 2: Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the Go modules files (go.mod and go.sum)
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Step 4: Download and install the Go dependencies
RUN go mod tidy

# Step 5: Copy the entire project source code into the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the Go application
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app .

# Step 7: Use a smaller base image to create a smaller production image
FROM alpine:latest

# Step 8: Install necessary dependencies (like curl, etc.) for the production environment if required
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

# Step 9: Set the working directory to /root
WORKDIR /root/

# Step 10: Copy the built Go binary from the builder stage to the production image
COPY --from=builder /app/app .

# Step 11: Expose the application port (default for HTTP in Go is 8080, but you can adjust if necessary)
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 12: Command to run the application when the container starts
CMD ["./app"]
